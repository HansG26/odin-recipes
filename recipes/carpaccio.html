        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This is a variation on the Harry's Bar 1950's invention of carpaccio.
        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 dashes hot pepper sauce (e.g. Tabasco™), or to taste</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>8 ounces frozen thinly sliced beef tenderloin carpaccio.</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon capers, for garnish</li>
            <li>1 lemon, cut into wedges</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In the container of a blender, combine the eggs, Dijon mustard, lemon juice, a pinch of salt and a dash of hot sauce.
                Cover and pulse to mix. Start the blender on medium speed and let run while pouring in the olive oil, and then the
                vegetable oil, in a thin continuous stream until the mixture is thick enough to coat the back of a metal spoon. Pour in
                the Worcestershire sauce and blend for about 10 seconds more. Taste and adjust salt if needed.
            </li>
            <li>
                Arrange the frozen beef on a serving plate in a semi-circle. Drizzle the sauce over the meat. Garnish with capers and
                freshly ground black pepper and squeeze a little lemon juice over the top. Let stand for 5 minutes before serving.

        </ol>
